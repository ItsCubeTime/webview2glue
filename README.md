# webview2glue
A Visual Studio project that produces 2 small dll files webview2glue.dll (85kb) &amp; WebView2Loader.dll (70kb), which exposes functions for managing webviews in Microsoft Windows (Webview2). Originally developed for my "Fast Python Library", but can be used by any app capable of loading &amp; communicating with dll files.

Based on https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples/tree/main/GettingStartedGuides/Win32_GettingStarted
